### Setting Up the Frontend Development Environment

Follow these simple steps to set up the frontend development environment:

### Steps to Run the Frontend

1. **Clone the Repository**
   If you haven't already done so, clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saihanhtet/meals-on-wheel.git
   cd meals-on-wheel
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install all required dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the App**
   To start the application, run two commands in separate terminal windows:

   - In the first terminal, start the Laravel backend:
     ```bash
     php artisan serve
     ```

   - In the second terminal, start the frontend with Vite:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

4. **Access the App**
   Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to view the app.

That's it! You should now have the frontend and backend running locally.
